Directions:
Use the array's forEach() method to loop over the following array
and add 100 to each of the values if the value is divisible by 3.

Remember that the "Test Run" button will display any logged content, so feel free to use console.log() to test your code.

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Another Type of Loop (6-8)
 *
 * Use the existing `test` variable and write a `forEach` loop
 * that adds 100 to each number that is divisible by 3.
 *
 * Things to note:
 *  - you must use an `if` statement to verify code is divisible by 3
 *  - you can use `console.log` to verify the `test` variable when you're finished looping
